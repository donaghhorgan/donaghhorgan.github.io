title: Voting rule optimisation for double threshold energy detector-based cognitive
  radio networks
---

# Abstract

The method by which individual decisions are combined in cooperative cognitive radio networks is crucial to minimising the overall probabilities of false alarm and missed detection. In this paper, general expressions for these probabilities are derived for a double threshold energy detector-based network, and an analytical solution for the optimal value of voting rule is found so that the overall probability of error is minimised. Simulation results show that there are significant advantages to the use of double threshold energy detector-based networks as opposed to their single threshold-based counterparts; additional simulations verify that the analytical solution is optimal.
